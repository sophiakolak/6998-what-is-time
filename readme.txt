Spatiotemporal cognition relies on overlapping and interact- ing systems that converge in the hippocampus. Although movement through space and time is thought to be coupled, spatial and temporal coding can be coded differentially in the hippocampus depending on the behavioral demands. Along with place cells that encode spatial features of the environ- ment, “time cells” fire at specific time points and durations thereby organizing our experiences temporally as well as spatially. One open question is how exactly the hippocampus organizes the combination of spatial and temporal aspects of memory, and how each of these features influence the interpretation of sensory stimuli when learning tasks. In this study, we examine activity recorded from CA1 neurons during a virtual navigation task, where identical odors are presented at different points along a four meter track. It has been shown that place cells and internal path integrators are calibrated by these odor landmarks. Here we examine the role that the time cell network plays in temporally structur- ing the experience of running on the 4m track. We compare time cell and place cell activity patterns during the task with and without odor, as well as during the reward period. We also assess the role of learning on time cell representations by examining the time cell patterns in no odor trials before and after learning.
